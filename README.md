# HueSurf

##  What is HueSurf?

HueSurf is a minimal, fast, and privacy-focused browser built on Chromium. We stripped out the annoying ads, sponsored junk, telemtry, bloat, and all that AI nonsense. This project is crafted by a trio of chill devs, with the plan of making web surfing clean and simple.

## Features

-  **No Ads, No Sponsors** – Surf the web distraction-free.
-  **No AI** – Your data stays yours, no weird bots lurking.
-  **Lightweight** – Minimal footprint, quick to start, easy on your systems RAM.
-  **Open Source** – Fork it and modify it however you like.

## Building from Source

HueSurf uses a **patch-based build system** that downloads Chromium source and applies HueSurf modifications (patches) during build time. This keeps our repository lightweight while enabling full customization.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/H3-Apps/HueSurf.git
cd HueSurf

# Make build script executable
chmod +x scripts/build.sh

# Start the build (This takes a while!)
./scripts/build.sh
```

**Requirements:**
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended)
- 50GB free disk space  
- Multi-core CPU (4+ cores recommended)
- 1-4 hours build time (depending on hardware)

**Supported Platforms:**
-  Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, Debian 10+, CentOS 8+)
-  macOS (10.15+ Catalina or later)
-  Windows (10/11 with Visual Studio 2019+)

For detailed build instructions, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).
