## 🚀 What is HueSurf?

HueSurf is a minimal, fast, and privacy-focused browser built on Chromium. We stripped out the annoying ads, sponsor junk, and all that AI nonsense. No telemetry, no bloat—just pure browsing vibes. This project is crafted by a trio of chill devs (and potentially a rogue robot COUGH jules COUGH gemini COUGH JavierAI), making web surfing clean and simple.
